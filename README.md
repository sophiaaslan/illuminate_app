# illuminate_app

Illuminate is a sexual wellness app created by women, for women. Me and my group members wanted to shed light to a topic that had been in the dark for so long, hence the name "Illuminate". The app is a safe space for women (and others who may benefit from this information) to learn more about themselves and their health regarding their sexuality and relationships. 

Illuminate was built using Flutter as our mobile framework in order to support IOS and Android. In a weekend, my group members and I learned the fundamentals of the dart lanaguage to create a functioning prototype of our application. 

Illuminate was made for DeltaHacks 2022, and we won the award "Seeing the future". We are all so proud of our project, and look forward to continue working on our application.
